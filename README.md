# Code_Clause-Plagirism_Checker
Cheating is the common term for plagiarism. Plagiarism is the act of someone taking another person's words or creative work and using it in their own work under that person's name. For instance, it would be considered plagiarised content if someone wrote an article for geeksforgeeks and then used text from another website or resource.
